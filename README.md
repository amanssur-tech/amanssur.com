### ✨ What is this?  
This is my **personal website & portfolio**. It’s the place where I introduce myself as an IT solutions consultant, showcase my projects, and give people a way to connect with me.  

### 🌍 Who is it for?  
- Businesses looking for **web, cloud, or automation solutions**  
- Recruiters and clients who want to **see my CV and portfolio**  
- Anyone curious about the work I do and the tools I use  

### 🛠️ How is it built? *(non-techie version)*  
The site is made with modern web tools that help it load fast, stay flexible, and scale well:  
- **Astro** → Think of it as the “builder” that puts the whole website together. It handles things like HTML, meta tags, and how pages are structured.  
- **Svelte** → This is what makes the site interactive (like forms, buttons, and navigation). You can imagine it as the “moving parts” inside the site.  
- **Cloudflare Pages** → This is where the site lives on the internet. It’s a service that delivers the site quickly to people anywhere in the world.  

### 📂 What’s inside this repo?  
- `/public` → Images, CV PDFs, fonts, icons, and other files that visitors can download or see directly.  
- `/src` → The actual code that defines how the site looks and behaves.  
  - `pages` → The different pages (Home, CV, Legal, etc.)  
  - `components` → Reusable parts (navigation bar, footer, contact form, etc.)  
  - `wrappers` → Page-level containers for layouts  
  - `lib` → Helper logic (translations, form validation, etc.)  
- `/services` → Scripts and automations (e.g. sending contact form submissions, Slack digests).
